Energy minimization workflow of a ligand-free protein using GROMACS for molecular docking and MD preparation.

# 🧬 Protein Energy Minimization Workflow using GROMACS

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a **step-by-step workflow** for performing  
**energy minimization of a ligand-free protein** using GROMACS.

To simplify reproducibility, the protocol assumes a single input file named:

**protein.pdb**

All commands are presented in a **standardized and synthetized format** to make the workflow easier to follow, reproduce, and teach.

The minimized structure can be used for:

- Molecular docking  
- Molecular dynamics simulations  
- Structural refinement  
- Structural visualization
